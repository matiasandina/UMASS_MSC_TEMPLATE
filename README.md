# UMASS_MSC_TEMPLATE

This repo contains a rough template for UMass Amherst Thesis.

The idea is to provide something that resembles the guidelines from UMass Amherst Grad School (see https://www.umass.edu/gradschool/sites/default/files/thesis_and_dissertation_guidelines.pdf).  

There's a compiled online version in Overleaf which you can visit at https://v2.overleaf.com/read/tzkbdshmmwqk.

The real thesis will be available soon at https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/ (I will update the link by then).
