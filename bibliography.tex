% This performs what we want
% bibliography with no number, and showing in the top of the pages

\setcounter{chapter}{-1}
\chapter{BIBLIOGRAPHY}
\renewcommand{\thechapter}{A}


If you decide to use this way to include bibliography you should export your bibliography as a .tex file and paste that into here.

I do not fully recomend that. I would use a .bib and change the setup on main.tex
